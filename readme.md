###  Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

getElementById is used to get one element by its unique id, getElementsByClassName is used to get many elements that have the same class name, and querySelector / querySelectorAll can use any CSS selector. querySelector gives the first match only, while querySelectorAll gives all matches.
